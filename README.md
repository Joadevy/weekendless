## Overview
Weekendless is a NextJS full-stack app to sell tickets for many events. Users can search for their favorites & buy their entries. Payments are processed by Mercado Pago in ARS (Argentine Peso). To acquire the tickets users need to log in with their Google accounts & when it's all done, an email will be sent to the attendee's email with details of the reservation.    
The app tries to replicate kind of the flow of a "real product" with its limitations but the main goal is to be as real as possible.
